American romanticists diverged from values of conformity and religion, paving the way for ideas based on individualism, nature, and self-reliance. The products of such a revolutionary time period are pieces of literature like The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, published in 1848, and Bartleby, the Scrivener: A story of Wall-Street by Herman Melville, published in 1853. The Scarlet Letter is a novel in which a woman, Hester Prynne, commits adultery with a reverend, Arthur Dimmesdale, and faces a Puritan society’s condemning attitude toward her sin. Bartleby, the Scrivener: A story of Wall-Street is a short story in which the main character, Bartleby, deteriorates in the face of society’s omnipresent pressures. In both pieces of literature, Hawthorne and Melville uphold a value on individualism through the use of society’s view of their primary characters, to denounce Dimmesdale and Bartleby for suffering from a desire to conform with society and to corroborate Hester Prynne’s success in separating from society’s strict values; thus the authors ultimately suggest that those who make decisions based on social acceptance forfeit not only a peace of mind but also the value they bring to society. Hawthorne upholds a value on individualism through his depiction of conformist individuals, such as Dimmesdale, as injured due to suffering from self-harm and a life without achievement, whereas he depicts those who part from societal suppression, such as Hester, as individuals who have achieved peace with themselves and are capable of contributing to society. Hawthorne condemns Dimmesdale’s superfluous influence on society’s opinion by depicting Dimmesdale as an individual wounded by the burden of social acceptance. Through the eyes of Hawthorne, it is inconceivable the agony with which this public veneration tortured him! […] He longed to speak […] and tell the people what he was ‘[…] I, your pastor, whom you so reverence and trust, am utterly a pollution and a lie!’ (Hawthorne 139) This agony Dimmesdale possesses, even from society’s veneration of his actions, is a result of lacking the strength to pursue individuality. If Dimmesdale were capable of ignoring the convictions of those surrounding him and valuing his unique individuality, no matter how sinful it may be, he would be capable of achieving tranquility. However, because Dimmesdale is incapable of telling his community about his act of adultery, he is continuously bombarded by a feeling that he is utterly a pollution and a lie. In addition, Dimmesdale is so suppressed by the hypocrisy surrounding his sin and his status in the Puritan society that he becomes capable of teaching solely because he himself has committed a sin and knows the toll it can take. However, this same admiration he achieves from his followers actually undermines his value to society simply because it makes him his own judge and prosecutor. Every word Dimmesdale says in his sermons is another word that he believes will provoke his own inescapable Puritan death; whereas in reality, all it takes is his ignorance of society. Thus, Dimmesdale is portrayed as a conformist who establishes his own misery by preaching for what he believes to be society’s opinion, inevitably making himself useless to society and confining himself to misery. Alongside Hawthorne’s development of Dimmesdale, Hawthorne uses Hester to demonstrate his support of individualism. Initially, he portrays her in a light that resonates society’s distaste for those who commit a sin, but later suggests that Hester simply does not care about what society thinks of her. Society now sees that such helpfulness was found in her,—so much power to do, and power to sympathize,—that many people refused to interpret the scarlet ‘A’ by its original signification. They said that it meant ‘Able’; so strong was Hester with a woman’s strength (Hawthorne 158) Hester, even after being ostracized for seven years, is still seen as a valuable, and even as a strong, individual. Hawthorne depicts her as a truly dynamic character, having been seen as a disgrace according to Puritan standards, to being seen as an able individual. She is capable of undercutting the influence that portrayed her as the scarlet letter ‘A’ for adulterer, and put in place her own definition of its presence, able. Hester has so much power to do, and power to sympathize because of the fact that she understands society for what it truly is, a group of sinners in which its members are concealed by their unwillingness to share the misdemeanors they have committed. This realization allows Hester to diverge from society’s oppression, opening her to a great value in individualism, and showing her that she can thrive without society. Hawthorne continues to depict her as a strong contributor to society, because she can convert the pressure society puts on others just how she converted her own scarlet letter from a sign of sin to a sign of revered singularity. She is able to help and sympathize with everyone around her, because everyone has committed a sin. She has built herself with a woman’s strength, separating her from society’s strict values, giving her peace of mind, and allowing her to contribute to society as a unique individual. Hester’s ability to neglect society’s ridicule is the sole reason that even after seven years of segregation she is still able to maintain a peace of mind and a value to society; in sharp contrast, Dimmesdale’s lack in doing so has forced him to toil with his own fate, forfeiting his peace of mind and the value he once brought to society. Much like Hawthorne’s depiction of Dimmesdale, Melville, upholding a value on individualism, portrays Bartleby’s change from an extremely productive individual to a futile member of society as a result of the growing burden of society’s ubiquitous pressures. In the beginning of this short story, Melville develops Bartleby as an innocent baby who is ready to be brought against the expectations and pressures of society. Later, however, Bartleby no longer has a baby’s ignorance, but a longing for social acceptance. When the narrator recalls his first encounter with Bartleby he sees that figure now – pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was Bartleby. […] [He] engaged him, glad to have among [his] corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an aspect, which [he] thought might operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of Turkey, and the fiery one of Nippers. (As cited in Masuda, 2015, p.4) Bartleby is depicted as a character who is nearly perfect in his appearance and mentality, untouched by society. However, Melville uses sharp contrast in his diction when he says that Bartleby, since not immersed in society since birth, is incurably forlorn, meaning he, despite being a well maintained figure, will always be ostracized by society for his individualism. This, yet again, shows how society, as it viewed Hester, initially condemns individuals for not conforming. The narrator, with his depiction of Bartleby as neat and respectable in nature, also suggests that he has not yet faced the need to be accepted into society, contrasting against the flighty temper of Turkey, and the fiery one of Nippers whose influence from society is prominent. The narrator reveres Bartleby’s individuality, instilling in him an appreciation for nonconformity. This appreciation, however, is not shared by the rest of society, causing the narrator to be the only home for Bartleby later on in the story. At this instance, Bartleby is peaceful and valuable in the eyes of the narrator much like how Hester is in the eyes of society; however Bartleby is yet to face the imperialism of society’s influence. Later in the story, it is apparent that there is a change that has occurred in Bartleby. The only possible change, since he resided in the office all day and night, must be a result of an influence from those around him, such as the narrator, Turkey, Nippers, and Ginger Nut. These characters become his society, and instill in him their beliefs and values. He learns from each of them an important lesson about what is socially acceptable. From Turkey he learns that an individual is accepted by society even if they are noisy, inflamed, and even reckless in their actions. Nippers shows him that it is fine to be irritable and hard to satisfy. Even Ginger Nut teaches him that foolishly following people’s requests puts a person in a plebeian position. An amalgamation of all these ideas from his society, allows him to develop his own false persona in order to conform to what he thinks society regards as acceptable. Through conforming to those around him, Bartleby loses peace with himself but feels it is worth it if he is no longer viewed as incurably forlorn, in direct correlation to how Dimmesdale inflicts pain upon himself for his sin but does not mention of it to society in order to maintain his conformity. With Nippers’ sense of dissatisfaction, Bartleby begins to say I prefer not to, and from then on is condemned by those around him for his discord, even though in truth he is trying to conform. After the narrator becomes perturbed that Bartleby has changed from his unique and capable self into an individual who prefers not to contribute to anything, he tries to coax Bartleby to become what he once was, unknowing that society’s influence is irreversible. He tries to convince him by telling him, ‘now one of two things must take place. Either you must do something, or something must be done to you. Now what sort of business would you like to engage in? Would you like to re-engage in copying for someone?’ / ‘No I would prefer not to make any change.’ (As cited in Masuda, 2015, p.18) After repeated offense Bartleby maintains his need to conform to those around him. In saying that he would prefer not to make any change Bartleby is making an effort to reiterate what society has told him. When the narrator asks Bartleby whether he would like to re-engage in copying for someone,. or have something done to him, he gives Bartleby the option of what to do. When Bartleby repeatedly says I prefer not. instead of saying I will not,. he, like the narrator, indicates that the person he is talking to has an option as to what to do, clearly showing the influence the narrator had on Bartleby. The narrator, along with the rest of society, consume his thoughts to the point where Bartleby is mindlessly reiterating what society has told him is appropriate. Consequently, Bartleby lacks the capability to contribute to society, both because he does not contribute to anything that is unknown and literally because he prefers not to do anything he is requested to do. This plays into the irony that Bartleby himself is a scrivener, proposing that Melville suggests that society can consume an individual so much that he or she is incapable of even copying what society has done. Melville continues this insecure depiction of Bartleby to show the irreversible toll society has on an individual, causing him to lack his own peace of thought and the value he brings to society. Thus, Melville ultimately suggests that Bartleby, a representation of the toll society can inflict on an individual, forfeits not only his peace of mind but also his ability to contribute to society. Through their literature, Hawthorne and Melville use their respective primary characters, Dimmesdale, Hester, and Bartleby to show the burden society can place on an individual. Dimmesdale and Bartleby epitomize the deleterious effects society can have by pressuring individuals to conform to what is thought to be the only way of life. Hester continues this understanding by proving that to be socially acceptable one must not conform with society, because that will only cause unrest in the mind and an inability to contribute to society, but one must uphold his or her own individualism. Thus, through both novels it can be concluded that society is a complex unit which initially looks down upon individuals based on their lack of conformity, but later indefinitely appreciates those who embrace and uphold a value on individualism.
